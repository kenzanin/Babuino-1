This folder contains an implementation of Blockly that runs as a Chrome Packaged Application. This was complicated by Blockly's use of a number practices that are prohibited by packaged applications for security reasons. Unfortunately, all of the experimentation to get around these restrictions has resulted in code that's a dog's breakfast. I hope one day to harmonise it better with Blockly so that developments for the latter can flow through.

To Do: Write much more here. Please email me if you can't work it out and can't wait.
