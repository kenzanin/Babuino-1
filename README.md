Babuino
=======
Files related to the Babuino Project - a low cost robotics platform based on 
Arduino hardware.

This repository was originally created as somewhere to put a version of the 
Babuino firmware that was written as an Arduino sketch. The directory structure
is set up to cater for the possibility that this might become a repository for
other software related to Babuino.
