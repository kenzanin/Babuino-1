Babuino
=======
Files related to the Babuino Project - a low cost robotics platform based on 
Arduino hardware.

There are currently three parts to this repository:

1) An arduino sketch implementing Cricket Logo and derived from code written for the Babuino project.

2) A Logo compiler and assembler implemented in JavaScript using the JS/CC parser tool. 

3) A version of Google Blockly that generates Cricket Logo, and also compiles it, and programs the Arduino/Babuino board.

The aim is to create a tool that is simple for users to install and use. Unfortunately that is not yet the case.
See readme files in the subdirectories for more information.
